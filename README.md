# AGNOCPEED

## Build steps

Git, NodeJS and NPM must be installed. Then type the following in a terminal to generate a build for your OS.

```
git clone https://github.com/anujdhillxn/agnocpeed.git
cd agnocpeed
npm install
npm run electron:build
```

## Usage

Run the executable generated by the build.
Read the settings section below.
Select a platform (Codeforces or Atcoder) or choose the practice mode.
Logging in or not logging in is upto you and some features won't work accordingly.
Enter a contest id. Future contest IDs are displayed in the table.

### Settings

Change the editor to the one that you currently have.
Make sure you have a template present for all the languages in the resources/extraResources/settings directory.
Make sure your system can support the run and compile commands that are mentioned.
Switch the headless property and you will understand what it means :P.

### Actions

All actions have a hotkey combination which can be changed. Must be a valid list of hotkeys separated by '+'.

### Statement

Only available in headless mode.

### Test Cases

The verdict is judged by string comparison and treating all whitespaces as a single space, then trimming the string.
All run commands will be executed upto 'Time Limit' seconds property in settings.

### Log

stdout or stderr of every command run by agnocpeed is displayed in the log.

## Known bugs

Infinite loops don't terminate after timeout in windows and need to be done manually.
